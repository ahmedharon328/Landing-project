Landing project.

this porject is about multi-section landing page .

I used HTML , CSS and JavaScript to build up this porject.

I used for of loops to create list which contains number of links related to the number of sections that has been added , 

i used addeventlistener on those links to scroll soomthly into the related section , and as well to set "your-active-class" class into active

i used addeventlisterner "scroll" to set "your-class-active" when the viewport is less than 350 , i used forHeading variable to change the color of

the head of section when the section is inside the viewport , as well as link too , it will chnage to  Yellow ,otherwise it will be White, i created a button

so when the end user scroll down into section 1 or like 400 yard the button will show up ,inside that button a text word "Top", it will

get the enduser to the top of the page and then button will be disappeared until endUser scroll down, and so on , i also created a icon

so when the enduser decrease the width of the page it will show an icon with only one section and when enduser click on that icon,

the other section will appear.
